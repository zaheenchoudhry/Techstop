When adding new products:

   To add a product on sale:
      - Put the discounted/cheaper price in the price column
      and put the original price in a new, 8th column

   To add a future product:
      - Make the productID > 9000
      - Put the product image in the FuterProducts folder inside the ProductsImages folder
      Note: Stock will be ignored for future products and it is not necessary to set a stock amount.
      
   For best results, please do the following when adding any new products:
      - include a picture of the product (prefferably same height and width)
      - If the product is in a new department, please put an image for the department 
      in the DepartmentIcons folder (prefferably same height and width)
      - If the product is a new brand please put a logo of the brand in the
      BrandLogos folder (prefferably same height and width)

Other Notes:
   - The inventory.txt file use the character | as its seperator character (not ,)
   - Our website has a repeated validation error since we put divs
   inside of input labels.
